/*Notice that we didnâ€™t have to change the method call at all. When you call a
method that requires a pointer receiver on a variable with a nonpointer type, Go
will automatically convert the receiver to a pointer for you. The same is true for
variables with pointer types; if you call a method requiring a value receiver, Go
will automatically get the value at the pointer for you and pass that to the
method.*/
